## Deep_Learning_NN
-## Implement NN classes

- [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) is a library to plot graphs in Python.
- [h5py](http://www.h5py.org) is a common package to interact with a dataset that is stored on an H5 file.
- [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) are used here to test your model with your own picture at the end.
- `dnn_app_utils` provides the functions implemented in the "Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step" assignment to this notebook.
- `np.random.seed(1)` is used to keep all the random function calls consistent. It helps grade your work - so please don't change it!
